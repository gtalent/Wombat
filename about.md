### What is this thing?
wombat is the world's the one million and first Pokemon clone.

### Cool, when will the game be released?
I don't know that there will ever be a game, as the project has no artists or musicians, or really anyone that is particularly passionate about games. I care about the software, there might be a game at some point if the right team comes along.

### So how far along is it?
Not very...

### Why call it wombat?
My high school computer science teacher, who played an enormous role in getting me started as a programmer, once said he had a thing about wombats. As a token way of honoring how he has influenced my life, I decided to name this project wombat.
I have also considered the name "nostalgia".
